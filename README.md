# Liri Node App

### This app is a search bot that retrieves song, concert, and movie information based on a user's input from the command line.

Liri Node App is primarily composed of two JavaScript files, liri.js and keys.js, with liri.js containing the executable functions, and keys.js exporting the related Spotify API keys.

## Instructions For App Usage

After installing the required NPMs within Node (related modules and technologies are listed below), a user is able to type an argument followed by a desired query name.

### Spotify-This-Song

If a user types ´node liri spotify-this-song <song title>´ in the command line, Liri will respond by displaying the 10 most relevant results.
 Each result is comprised of the artist's name, the song title, the album containing the song, and, if available, a link to a Spotify preview of the track.
